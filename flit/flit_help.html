<H2>INTRO</H2>
<p>Flit is an applet 'tray', currently offering clock, master sound volume
control, and battery monitor. It is written to be small and low-overhead, 
using the FLTK user interface library, so it is especially efficient on TinyCore Linux. 
The source code of Flit is released under the GNU license. 
See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ for more details.
</p>
<p>There is a menu of choices made available through right-clicking on Flit, or
pressing the Esc key after setting keyboard focus to Flit.  The sound control 
applet has several keyboard shortcuts (see <a href="#sound">below</a>).
</p>
<p>If you don't want to see all three applets, you can disable one or two 
of them in the right-click menu, but not all three!</p>
<p>
'Hover' your mouse pointer over each applet to get more 
detailed information.  The battery recharge time estimate is very 
approximate in this release.  (I hope to improve the algorithm soon!) </p>
<p>
If you want to start Flit automatically, invoke it in the .xsession 
(or equivalent) startup script file, using a &amp; symbol to return control 
immediately to the script, like this:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/path/to/flit &amp;</p>


<a name="clock"></a>
<H2>CLOCK</H2>
<p>
The only option for the clock is 24-hour time format, or 12-hour format with
AM or PM indication.  Use the right-click menu to toggle between these modes.</p>

<a name="sound"></a>
<H2>SOUND CONTROL</H2>
<p>
The current sound volume level is indicated by the number and size of the 
sound "rays" next to the speaker icon.  To adjust the volume, place your mouse 
cursor over the speaker and use the mouse scroll wheel (or equivalent) to adjust 
the sound volume in 5% increments. You may also use the following keystrokes:
<br>
Louder: Menu + Alt+U, or Up arrow cursor key, or + key<br>
Quieter: Menu + Alt+L, or Down arrow cursor key, or - key<br>
Mute/Unmute: Menu + Alt+M, or Pause key<br>
<br> 
Future versions may also provide a pop-up slider control. </p>
<p>
The sound control requires an OSS "mixer" device '/dev/mixer' to be present. 
There is a lot of variation in how sound devices can be controlled, but Flit 
will try to support some common methods.  By default, Flit will try to find 
an appropriate mixer control to adjust the overall playback volume.  You can 
override this behavior by specifying an exact OSS mixer control name in the 
.flit.conf file, in the "oss_control_name =" statement.  If the name is 
"autosel", Flit will do the default auto-selection.  But if you know that 
you get best results from a specific mixer control, such as "vol" or "pcm" 
or something else, put it name into the .flit.conf file, such as:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>oss_control_name = pcm</code>
<br>
If flit is not successful in finding a suitable control (which must be marked 
with the MASTER_VOLUME or PCM_VOLUME in OSS), you won't see the sound control 
applet in Flit.  You may want to try the graphical mixer application ossxmix 
(note the X in the name) or command-line application ossmix and experiment 
with the controls made available for your hardware to see which ones can  
control the volume.  If OSS + your hardware don't support an adjustable output 
volume, you may still be able to use a mute control with Flit.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS: The OSS vmix software mixer control will only work if vmix is fully 
"attached" to your audio hardware (beyond the scope of this document). ALSA is not 
supported (at least not yet, anyway).
</p>

<a name="batt"></a>
<H2>BATTERY MONITOR</H2>
<p>
In the battery icon, charge is colored green if the level is 40% or higher, 
yellow when 20% or higher, and red below 20%.  If the estimated charge 
Is less than 13%, the outline of the battery icon will slowly flash red. 
When recharging power is available, an AC power plug icon is shown over the 
battery icon.  If the battry is discharging, the remaining charge percentage 
number is shown above the battery icon.</p>
<p>
The battery monitor requires information in the /proc/acpi system information, 
so you must boot Linux with the 'laptop' kernel option or load the appropriate 
ACPI kernel module.</p>
<p>
<a name="general"></a>
<H2>GENERAL OPTIONS</H2>
You can choose one of appearance styles:<br>
&nbsp;a) Normal: black on light gray, with a sunken tray effect <br>
&nbsp;b) Inverse: light gray on black, also with a sunken tray effect <br>
&nbsp;c) 'Transparent', which has a background color slightly lighter than the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X11 root window where Flit plans to appear and a contrasting <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreground color, with a flat effect, which matches <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wbar nicely.  If the planned location is occupied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by a window when Flit starts, its background color <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be based on that.</p>
<p>
You may reposition Flit with your mouse (left-click + drag), or hand-edit 
the .flit.conf configuration file (see cautions below).  The location can be 
defined to one of the four corners (se = SouthEast, i.e. the lower-right corner, and 
so on) or a x,y pair.  See the configuration file for an example.</p>
<p>
<a name="config"></a>
<H2>SAVING PREFERENCES</H2>
Use the 'Save configuration' command to make flit remember your preferences by 
writing the .flit.conf file in your home directory (as defined by the $HOME 
environment variable).  You may edit this file with a text editor, but please 
preserve the spelling, capitalization, and spacing of content to prevent 
parsing problems.  You can revert to default settings by deleting the 
.flit.conf file and restarting Flit.</p>
