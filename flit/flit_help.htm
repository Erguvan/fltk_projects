<H2>INTRO</H2>
<p>Flit is an applet 'tray', currently offering clock, master sound volume
control, and battery monitor. It is written to be small and low-overhead, 
using the FLTK user interface library, so it is especially efficient on TinyCore Linux. 
The source code of Flit is released under the GNU license. 
See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ for more details.
</p>
<p>Newest features: As of version 1.3.0, Jakob Bysewski has added code to 
make Flit dockable in some window managers and to allow Flit to appear in 
all desktop screens.  Also, code was added to prevent starting multiple 
copies of flit unintentionally, although you may now pass a special option 
to force Flit to launch again. Furthermore, you may specify the name of an
alternative config file (besides .flit.conf).  See the Commandline options
immediately below for more information</p>
<p>Commandline options:</p>
<p><b>-a = All desktops:</b> Make flit appear on all desktops (experimental)</p>
<p><b>-d = Dock:</b> Make flit dock by setting _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK</p>
<p><b>-m = Multiple:</b> Allow multiple instances of flit (not allowed by default now)</p>
<p><b>-c CONF = Config file:</b> use CONF instead of ~/.flit.conf for configuration</p>
<p>By combining -m and -c, you can load differnt Flit applets into different 
areas of your screen.</p>
<p>There is a menu of choices made available through right-clicking on Flit.  The sound 
control applet has several additional keyboard shortcuts (see <a href="#sound">below</a>).
The Flit menu may optionally be opened automatically by a Ctrl key, as defined in the 
<a href="#general">General Options</a> section.
</p>
<p>If you don't want to see all three applets, you can disable one or two 
of them in the right-click menu, but not all three!</p>
<p>
'Hover' your mouse pointer over each applet to get more 
detailed information.  The battery recharge time estimate is 
approximate.</p>
<p>
If you want to start Flit automatically, invoke it in your /opt/bootlocal.sh 
startup script or make a custom .xsession script file, and use a &amp; symbol to 
return control immediately to the script, like this:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/path/to/flit &amp;<br>
Note: The base configuration of TinyCore Linux versions 2.3 through 2.9
automatically started Flit during the startx sequence.  Versions 2.10 and later do not, so
you will need to update .xsession or /opt/bootlocal.sh as described above. </p>
<a name="clock"></a>
<H2>CLOCK</H2>
<p>
The only option for the clock is 24-hour time format, or 12-hour format with
AM or PM indication.  Use the right-click menu to toggle between these modes. 
Hover the mouse pointer to see date and year in addition to time.</p>

<a name="sound"></a>
<H2>SOUND CONTROL</H2>
<p>
The current sound volume level is indicated by the number and size of the 
sound "rays" next to the speaker icon.  To adjust the volume, place your mouse 
cursor over the speaker and use the mouse scroll wheel (or equivalent) to adjust 
the sound volume in 5% increments. You may also use the following keystrokes:
<br>
Louder: Ctrl+U, or Up arrow cursor key, or + key<br>
Quieter: Ctrl+L, or Down arrow cursor key, or - key<br>
Mute/Unmute: Ctrl+M, or Pause key<br>
<br> 
Future versions may also provide a pop-up slider control. </p>
<p>
The sound control requires an OSS "mixer" device '/dev/mixer' or the ALSA
amixer utility to be present. 

There is a lot of variation in how sound devices can be controlled depending 
on your audio hardware, but Flit 
will try to support some common methods.  By default, Flit will try to find 
an appropriate mixer control parameter to adjust the overall playback volume.  
You can override this behavior by specifying an exact OSS or ALSA mixer 
control name in the .flit.conf file, in the "sound_control_name =" statement.  If the name is 
"autosel", Flit will do the default auto-selection.  But if you know that 
you get best results from a specific mixer control, such as "vol" or "pcm" 
or something else, put it name into the .flit.conf file, such as:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>sound_control_name = pcm</code>
<br>
If flit is not successful in finding a suitable control (which must be marked 
with the MASTER_VOLUME or PCM_VOLUME in OSS or pvolume in ALSA), you won't see 
the sound control applet in Flit, and you won't be able to "unhide" it.  You may want to manually  experiment with one or move sound mixer utilities such as 
ossxmix (note the X in the name) or amixer and experiment with the controls made available for your 
hardware to see which ones can control the volume.  If OSS/ALSA + your hardware does
not support an adjustable output volume, you may still be able to use a mute 
control with Flit.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS: If using OSS, the vmix software mixer control will only work if vmix is fully 
"attached" to your audio hardware (beyond the scope of this document). ALSA is now 
supported, but is not widely tested with different sound devices.

<a name="batt"></a>
<H2>BATTERY MONITOR</H2>
<p>
In the battery icon, charge is colored green if the level is 40% or higher, 
yellow when 20% or higher, and red below 20%.  If the estimated charge 
Is less than 13%, the outline of the battery icon will slowly flash red. 
When recharging power is available, an AC power plug icon is shown over the 
battery icon.  If the battry is discharging, the remaining charge percentage 
number is shown above the battery icon.</p>
<p>
Version 1.2.0 now supports the OLPC XO-1 laptop and computers with the ACPI s
system.  For ACPI, boot Linux with the 'laptop' kernel option or load the appropriate 
ACPI kernel module to ensure Flit can find the info it needs under /proc/acpi.  
About three minutes after a switch between charging 
and discharging, Flit will begin showing estimates of the remaining time.</p>
<p>
<a name="general"></a>
<H2>GENERAL OPTIONS</H2>
By default, Flit will automatically pop up the right-click menu if Flit has the keyboard 
focus and you press either Ctrl key, which you may do as part of a Ctrl+key 
combination.  If you would prefer to not have Flit open the menu on Ctrl keypress, 
select the 'Toggle Ctrl key menu activation' menu option and then <a href="#config">save</a> 
the configuration.</p>
<p>
You can choose one of these appearance styles:<br>
&nbsp;a) Normal: black on light gray, with a sunken tray effect <br>
&nbsp;b) Inverse: light gray on black, also with a sunken tray effect <br>
&nbsp;c) 'Transparent', which has a background color slightly lighter than the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X11 root window where Flit plans to appear and a contrasting <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreground color, with a flat effect, which matches <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wbar nicely.  If the planned location is occupied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by a window when Flit starts, its background color <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be based on that.<br>
&nbsp;d) Custom: The colors defined in the config file, or by default, a blue <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color that works with the default background to <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make flit look invisible.<br>

<p>
You may reposition Flit with your mouse (left-click + drag), or hand-edit 
the .flit.conf configuration file (see cautions below).  The location can be 
defined to one of the four corners (se = SouthEast, i.e. the lower-right corner, and 
so on) or a x,y pair.  See the configuration file for an example.</p>
<p>
As of version 1.2.0, you can scale the size of Flit!  If you have a high-resolution screen and you would
like the Flit applets to be larger, you may enter a new zoom factor in the .flit.conf file.  First, make sure 
you save your preferences (as described below), then edit the .flit.conf file in your home directory, changing 
the line
<code>zoom = 1.0</code>
to new value.  A factor of 1.5 would be 150% of the normal size (50% larger), 2.0 would be double-size, and 
so on.  Smaller than normal sizes are possible too.  Note that some factors will look better than others.  In
general, factors that are nice ratios will work better, e.g. 3/4 = 0.75, 4/3 = 1.33, et cetera.
<p>As of version 1.3.0, you may define foreground and background colors:<br>
<code>custom_fg = 128,255,128</code><br>
<code>custom_bg = 32,32,32</code><br>
where the numbers range from 0 to 255 and specify amound of red, green, and blue respectively.
</p>

<H2>SAVING PREFERENCES</H2>
Use the 'Save configuration' command to make flit remember your preferences by 
writing the .flit.conf file in your home directory (as defined by the $HOME 
environment variable).  You may edit this file with a text editor, but please 
preserve the spelling, capitalization, and spacing of content to prevent 
parsing problems.  You can revert to default settings by deleting the 
.flit.conf file and restarting Flit.</p>
